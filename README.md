# PyVCFToolkit

What is PyVCFToolkit?
Yet another Vcard parser library in python based on re module which is still under development.


Why yet another VCF parser library?
One may ask" with the plethora of vcf parser libraries out in pypi.org why are you bothering youself reinveting the wheel?
Well,... I started this project for some reasons. 
First, I decided to develop PyVCFToolkit on my own as a practical pythonic hobby project to learn and explore Python. In a larger scale porject, I hope that I can use it in a project intended for regorganizing my contacts in my cell phone ( you know, there are some darn messengers which, after giving them the right to access your contact lists, make a mess out of them. and you finally end up having dozens of Mr. Smith without any details). 

Second, with most of Apps showing ads and/or collecting and selling your personal data while promising not these days, I tried to develop an library for my personal use that does not any of these. As far as I know, the underlying technologies I used for developing this library do not show ads or collect personal data, hence; I can not garantee that they do not. 


Can I use and/or modify it?
Yeah, why not? However, I really look forward to make the main branch of the project stronger and better to turn it into an AIO purple cow. Bear in mind that,I have been developing this project for my personal use and I shared it here in hope that it would be useful for someone someday. By no means, I do not garantee it working properly. Thus, I am not resposible anything bad happens to you or your beloved device or contact list. it:
 not running on your device,
erasing all or some parts of your contacts data,
blow up your PC or Mac or mobile,
etc.
By the way, Always make back ups and use it on your own risk.


Finally, I grant you the permission to share, redistribute, and change it for your personal none-commerical use without any warranty.
